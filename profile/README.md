# Welcome to Ryan Enterprises Open Source

## What is Open Source?

Open source is a way to share code and ideas with the world. It is a way to share code that is free to use, and it is a way to share ideas that anyone can repurpose, share, and make their own.

## What We Do Here

Ryan Enterprises uses GitHub to develop and maintain our own projects, or technologies that we use in our projects, that we deem would be beneficial to be open-source.

## What you can do to help

One of the best parts about open source is that the community can contribute to their favorite projects. All of our public repositories are open to contributions, and we encourage you to join the community and contribute to our projects, granted you follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and the [Contibution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
